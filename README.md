# python-api-challenge

This is my submission for Module 6 Challenge with Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp.

The Notebook files can be found above in this repo.

There is 1 sub folder containing a .csv data file and some .png figures. The WeatherPy.ipynb notebook contains my analysis of the data with some drawn conclusions using API's to pull data from OpenWeatherMap and stores the results in cities.csv. The VacationPy.ipynb notebook uses the data from cities.csv to show cities on a map and some spots that meat my weather requirements on a map.

To run this code you will need to edit api_keys.py and place your API key.
